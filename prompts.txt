Can you come up with a plan to add this functionality. Here are the high level things I am thinking:
Backend: @backend 
1. Database level changes (new table, etc)
2. APIs to support creating, updating (user and admin)
@frontend 
3. Adding / updating pages to submit a request in the @frontend 
4. Adding / updating pages to review/approve requests. And for approved requests assigning them to darshan slot.
5. Interface to manage darshan slots.

Can you come up with a plan?


Build a portal to people to request for appointments with Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar. 

The portal will have 4 pages

Page 1: Landing page:
- Integrate mandatory Google login

Page 2: Post login, appointment request form
- The form will be used by Dignitaries, point of contacts for dignitaries or Gurudev's secretarriat.
- When requesting an appointment, the person can request for themselves or a dignitary
- Inputs for the appointment request form are attached in the screenshot.
- In the request form, they can select an existing dignitary they have requested for in the past, and autofill the details.

Page 3: Appointment status:
- The POC can view list of their appointment requests and status of the same.

Page 4: Dignitary list:
- The POC can view the list of dignitaries they have requested for

Page 5: Profile page:
- The POC can update their first name, last name, phone number









Lets do below:

(1) Convert @backend code to FastAPI
(2) Create the API for creating appointments and update @AppointmentRequestForm.tsx to call the API on submit. Anything else?
(3) When a user logs in, lets create a user in @user.py if it does not exist. If exists we might need to pull their ID to the front end? We would also need to verify the Google login on the backend by hitting the Google APIs?
(4) Update the backend to manage some kind of authentication for the front end app to call the APIs. I am assuming JWT using the Google token.
(5) Update the models to ensure all attributes in @frontend code is also present in backend for dignitary





For every change being made, share the all details in bulleted form before you make the change. Get confirmation from me that they look good, and only then make the changes.


Please do not assume anything. Please ask me if something is not clear.
